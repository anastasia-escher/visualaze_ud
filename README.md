# Visualize Universal Dependencies

This is an application for visualizing syntactic relations within sentences
using [universal dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) annotation developed at the 
[Slavisches Seminar of the University of Zurich](https://www.slav.uzh.ch/de.html). 


The application makes use of the [react-archer](https://github.com/pierpo/react-archer)
package in order to illustrate 
syntactic relations between sentence elements in a hierarchical tree-like plot and provides several
frequency tables based on the imported data. 

This is an open source application. Anyone can download the code and make any changes for their own use.

## Data policy

The application does not collect any user data. All entered queries are deleted after processing and not available for other purposes.
